Title: Bag of Little Bootstraps for Modelling
Version: 0.1.0
Author: John Mayhew
Maintainer: <jmmayhew@ucdavis.edu>
Description: This package uses bag of little bootstraps algorithm to apply modelling techniques on sub-samples of data. For a given data set with more than one variable, this package splits the data set into even sub-sections, fits a model to each sub-section of data, and then returns the mean coefficient values.
    This package is also useful for constructing confidence intervals; because of the nature of bootstrap algorithms, there is a large enough sample of models which can be used reliably to construct confidence intervals based on percentiles rather than model assumptions.
